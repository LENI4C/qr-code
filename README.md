## Overview

- Overall I think this is a pretty interesting project, something a beginner level developer can use to get their hands dirty with some code, test how much they really know and can do, this project only requires that you know HTML, CSS and responsive design (responsive design is basically CSS nothing too serious a quick google search and you'll see).

## My process

- First off I got all the materials I needed i.e (HTML mark up, a styles.md guide for picking out the same colours and styling, the images and the design overview of the challenge) from the (https://frontendmentor.io) website, then I uploaded the skeleton materials to a new github repository i'd just opened, afterwards I began to edit the markdown files and customize it to my taste, then code, read, YouTube, code, after I was done with the code part of it I started to load the markdown files with more information and boom, the end.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS variables
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- It's my first time working with markdown files so this challenge got me into wanting to understand what markdown files are and why so many developers use it.

- The challenged caused me to want to know more about basically ( how to create better and professional looking layouts) i.e flexbox and grid although specifically Grid, because I have above intermediate grasp of flexbox already.

### Continued development

- I will improve on my understanding of CSS layouts and see if there are any more fun things I can add to my projects to make it just a little more awesomeeee ( a little Kevin Powell reference here )

### Useful resources

- [Getting the grasp and basic concept of markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me understand what markdown is and how to write pretty cool markdowns

- [Understanding Layouts]() - This is an amazing resource which I have been using before now to improve my CSS, I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. And of course there's many of them perhaps too many to put in one short markdown write up but i feel this would be more than enough to get started plus I think Kevin's the best (probably a bit biased judgement but yen yen yen )
